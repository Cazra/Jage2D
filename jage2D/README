Jage2D is a Javascript + Canvas based 2D game engine. It is designed to not have to 
rely on any external scripts such jQuery and to be cross-browser compatible. This game  
engine also supports multiple Jage2D applications running in the same web page! 

I'll eventually get around to expanding this README and creating some example applications. 
Hang in there until then!

All components and examples of Jage2D, unless otherwise specified, have been tested in 
Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 9.

Requirements:
----------------
Your web browser must support the following features to use the JAGE 2D library:
* Javascript must be turned on.
* It must support HTML 5.

FAQ:
----------------
Q: "Why won't the imageEffects examples work?"
A: Most browsers prevent Canvas from directly reading the pixels of images from 
   cross-origin sources. For whatever reason, files on your own machine count as being
   from cross-origin sources for this. 
   
   Here's how you get around it to run the examples 
   on your own machine: 
   
   Install Python on your machine if you don't already have it. 
   Open a command prompt at your root working directory. (the same directory as this README file 
   if you're playing with the examples in a cloned Jage2D repository). 
   Enter "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" into the command prompt. You now have a localhost server! 
   
   The images in those examples should work now as long as you access them from localhost:8000. 
   
   For example, if you want to run "/examples/imageEffects/add.html", enter the address 
   "localhost:8000/examples/imageEffects/add.html" into your browser's address bar.
